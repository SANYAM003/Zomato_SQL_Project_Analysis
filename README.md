## Project Overview
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of a Zomato dataset using SQL. The primary goal is to extract data-driven insights that will help in understanding business operations, customer behavior, and restaurant performance. By leveraging SQL for this analysis, we aim to provide actionable information to improve business strategy.

The project is structured around key business questions to ensure the analysis is focused and relevant. Our main objectives are to:

1. Identify Top-Performing Restaurants: We will analyze ratings and reviews to find the highest-rated restaurants, as well as the most popular cuisines and locations with high demand.

2. Understand Customer Preferences: The analysis will delve into customer ordering patterns to determine the most popular dishes and food categories, helping to identify what a typical Zomato customer enjoys.

3. Extract Business Insights: We will calculate metrics like average order value, and identify peak hours and busiest days to help Zomato improve its operational efficiency and resource allocation.

4. Conduct Geographical Analysis: This involves examining sales and ratings on a city-by-city or location-by-location basis to highlight regional trends.



## Tech Stack
